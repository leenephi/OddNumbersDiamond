This is based off of a midterm assignment we received in a visual basic programming class.
The goal was to create a diamond number pattern I drew out in the OddNumbersDiamond.java file.
I had missed a class where some specific code was given for the pattern, 
and there in class I had a frustrating time deciding how to make out the pattern. 

I didn't finish, so that night at home I made myself bust it out in Java to at least 
prove to myself that I could finish it. Later on we caught a glimpse of the solution and I saw 
(I wasn't surprised; I knew my solution was way too complicated XD) that although it was 
related to mine, it was far simpler. 

Anyway, so fork this baby and make it simpler! ;) 
Either way, I had fun doing some straight up Java rather than Android.
